# Brief Description

This project is an interactive physics simulator which primarily focuses on simulating the interaction between concave meshes (such as a bottle) and a body of water in real-time.
Where necessary, it sacrifices accuracy for performance and/or aesthetics.

It features a position-based 3D physics engine written from scratch, which supports arbitrary concave meshes by computing their inertia tensor.
To simulate the water, we implement a height field fluid simulation with adaptive time-stepping, and carefully couple forces between it and the physics engine.
To ensure that our simulation updates do not block our rendering and vice-versa, the project features robust multithreading.
The entire scene is then rasterised by OpenGL (we use version 3.3 for compatibility).

To allow the user to easily simulate a large variety of scenes, the project features a JSON loader that can load scene objects. See the `How to Use This?` section below for more.

For more details, kindly see the technical report as well as the extensive code documentation available via `doxygen`.
Documentation should be generated in the `docs/compiled/` folder when the project is compiled, provided `doxygen` is available.

# How to Build This?

CMake gave us a lot of problems throughout development.
If something does not work, please contact us!

## Installing Dependencies

When the repo is first pulled down, you must pull down the relevant git submodules of dependency libraries.
To do so, execute,
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
## Generating Build Files

Skip the first step if you have already built the project once and have not added/removed source or header files nor edited cmake build files.
In this instance, you don't need new build files.

If you have not built the project yet, or if you add/remove source or header files, first run,
```sh
# for windows
cmake --preset windows-debug   # for debug mode
cmake --preset windows-release # for release mode

# for everyone else
cmake --preset debug   # for debug mode
cmake --preset release # for release mode
```
This generates the actual build files for your compilation setup.

***IMPORTANT NOTE:***
Your default compiler may not support C++20 fully!
This can lead to strange circumstances where, e.g, you cannot find `std::format` during compilation.
If you are on the Linux student server, then this is most likely the case.
Please supply a C++ compiler that can support C++20 via the command below
```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/compiler --preset <your_preset>
```
## Building

Then to actually build the project run,
```sh
# for windows
cmake --build --preset windows-debug -j 8   # for debug build
cmake --build --preset windows-release -j 8 # for release build

# for everyone else
cmake --build --preset debug -j 8   # for debug build
cmake --build --preset release -j 8 # for release build
```
# How to Use This?

Once built run the `CS488` executable to launch the program.

For Windows, the executable should be `build/windows-debug/Debug/CS488.exe` or `build/windows-release/Release/CS488.exe` or maybe even in `build/windows-debug/CS488.exe` or `build/windows-release/CS488.exe`.
Please make sure to run from the build directory to ensure assets and shaders are found correctly.

Otherwise, the executable should be `build/debug/CS488` or `build/release/CS488`.

## Loading Scenes

By default, the executable runs and displays the default scene, which is just a grid of water with an initial hump in the centre.

To load other scenes, pass the `--scene /path/to/scene.json` flag at launch.
The directory `scenes/` includes a few that show off various objectives.

## Movement, Pausing and Playing Simulation, Other Controls

When the simulator starts up, the physics and water simulation is by default paused.
This means that physics bodies do not spawn in/out, and they, along with the water and particle effects, stay static.

Pressing the `p` key unpauses the simulation.
This also causes your crosshair to appear in the centre of your screen.
Pressing it again switch back to the pause state.

To debug draw bounding boxes around physics objects, as well as around point lights which are otherwise untextured, press the `k` key.
Pressing it again will go back to hiding them.

To look/move around, first left-click into the simulator.
Then the mouse can be used to look around.
Also once clicked in, you can move the camera with Minecraft controlls.
That is, `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys move the camera in the x-z plane only.
And the `space`/`shift` keys move the camera up and down respectively.
Press `escape` to click out of the simulator and free up your mouse.

When clicked in with the simulator unpaused, left-click will throw a bottle in the direction you are looking with some random spin and speed.
Please note that physics objects are despawned if they fall too low, and if they are too near the pool walls on the outside, they may be snapped into the pool if the water is enabled (this is to prevent objects in the water from falling past the edge and works well if they are in the pool to begin with).

## Writing Scenes

Scene files are JSON documents that define the complete setup for a physics simulation, including objects, lighting, and water configuration.
The scene loader supports both physics-enabled objects and static geometry: rendered with a flat texture shader, lighting shader, or a sun shader.

The schema is defined as
```json
{
  "physicsObjects": [...],
  "staticObjects": [...], 
  "pointLights": [...],
  "waterEnabled": true/false,
  "waterInitialHumpSize": 0.4
}
```
### Physics Objects

Physics objects participate in rigid body simulation with collision detection and fluid interaction.

- Required Fields:
    - `modelPath`: Path to .obj model file (string)
    - `scale`: Uniform scale (number) or per-axis scale (`[x, y, z]`)
    - `initPos`: Initial position `[x, y, z]` (array of 3 numbers)
    - `initVel`: Initial velocity `[x, y, z]` (array of 3 numbers)
    - `initAngVel`: Initial angular velocity `[x, y, z]` (array of 3 numbers)
    - `density`: Object density in kg/mÂ³ (number, must be > 0)
- Optional Fields:
    - `shader`: Shader type - "flat", "light", or "sun" (default: "flat")
    - `name`: Display name for debugging (default: "Unnamed Physics Object")

### Static Objects

Static objects are rendered but don't participate in physics simulation.

- Required Fields:
    - `modelPath`: Path to .obj model file (string)
    - `scale`: Uniform scale (number) or per-axis scale (`[x, y, z]`)
    - `position`: World position `[x, y, z]` (array of 3 numbers)
    - `shader`: Shader type - "flat", "light", or "sun" (string)
- Optional Fields:
    - `rotation`: Euler angles in degrees `[x, y, z]` (default: `[0, 0, 0]`)
    - `name`: Display name for debugging (default: "Unnamed Static Object")

### Point Lights

Up to 4 point lights are supported for scene illumination.

- Required Fields:
    - `position`: Light position `[x, y, z]` (array of 3 numbers)

- Optional Fields :
    - `ambientColour`: `[0.1, 0.1, 0.1]` - Base illumination RGB
    - `diffuseColour`: `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]` - Main light colour RGB
    - `specularColour`: `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]` - Highlight colour RGB
    - `constantFalloff`: 1.0 - Constant attenuation term
    - `linearFalloff`: 0.35 - Linear attenuation term
    - `quadraticFalloff`: 0.44 - Quadratic attenuation term

Note that colour values should be in range [0.0, 1.0]. **Falloff values** must be non-negative.

### Water Configuration

Controls the shallow water simulation system.

- `waterEnabled`: Enable/disable water simulation (boolean, default: true)
- `waterInitialHumpSize`: Initial wave height (float, default: 0.4)

### Shader Types

- `flat`: No lighting calculations, uniform color
- `light`: Blinn-Phong shading with diffuse and specular components
- `sun` : Enhanced lighting suitable for primary objects

We recommend the following:
- Use `flat` shader for pools and background geometry
- Use `sun` shader for primary physics objects when water is enabled

### Validation Rules

- Model files must exist at specified paths
- Scale values must be positive for all objects
- Density must be positive for physics objects
- Color values must be non-negative
- Maximum 4 point lights per scene
- All required fields must be present
