/**
 * @class PhysicsEngine
 * @brief Manages and simulates a collection of rigid bodies.
 * @ingroup physics
 *
 * @details The engine is the top-level orchestrator for the physics simulation.
 * Its main responsibility is to drive the simulation loop each frame.
 *
 * @section Architecture
 * The engine's design incorporates several key patterns:
 * - **Separation of Concerns:** Collision logic is entirely delegated to the
 * static `SuperCollider` class. The engine's role is to manage state and
 * orchestrate the main simulation phases.
 * - **Flyweight Pattern:** It separates intrinsic, static data
 * (`RigidBodyCharacteristics`) from extrinsic, dynamic state (`RigidBodyData`).
 * By storing shared pointers to characteristics, multiple instances of the same
 * object type can share this data, significantly reducing memory usage.
 * - **Asynchronous Creation:** A `Receiver` channel is used to queue requests
 * for new bodies. This decouples the physics thread from other threads,
 * allowing for safe object creation without race conditions.
 *
 * @section Technicality
 * This engine employs a **Position-Based Dynamics (PBD)** approach. Unlike
 * force/momentum-based methods, the state of each body is primarily defined by
 * its current and previous positions and orientations.
 *
 * The core of the simulation is the **Position Verlet integration** scheme
 * implemented in `RigidBodyData::integrate`. Velocity is represented implicitly
 * as the difference between the current and previous positions over the time
 * step. The next position is then extrapolated from these two points, with an
 * added term for acceleration:
 * \f$ x_{n+1} = x_n + (x_n - x_{n-1}) \cdot d_{linear} + \frac{F}{m} \cdot
 * \Delta t^2 \f$ where \f$x_n\f$ is the current position, \f$x_{n-1}\f$ is the
 * previous position, \f$d_{linear}\f$ is a damping factor,
 * \f$F\f$ is the total force, and \f$m\f$ is the mass. A similar Verlet-like
 * scheme is used for rotational motion using quaternions.
 *
 * This method is computationally efficient and is particularly known for its
 * excellent stability, even with large time steps. It is the foundation for
 * modern PBD techniques where constraints are resolved by directly manipulating
 * particle positions.
 *
 * The simulation loop in `updateRigidBodies` proceeds as follows:
 * 1.  **Command Processing:** Create new bodies from the channel.
 * 2.  **State Integration:** Call `integrate` on each body to advance its
 * position based on its history and applied forces.
 * 3.  **Collision Handling:** Invoke `SuperCollider` to detect and resolve
 * penetrations. In a PBD context, this resolution often involves directly
 * correcting the positions of colliding bodies.
 *
 * @section Data and Code Sources
 * Position-Based Dynamics and Verlet integration are foundational topics in
 * physical simulation. The techniques are detailed in numerous sources, with
 * seminal work including the paper "Position Based Dynamics" by Matthias MÃ¼ller
 * et al. (2007) (who also was a major contributor to the water simulation
 * paper we used. Thanks Matthias!)
 *
 * The quaternion math used to compute rotational dynamics was inspired by
 * "Robust rotational-velocity-Verlet integration methods" by Dmitri Rozmanov et
 * al. (2010), as well as the "Physics - Kinematics - Angular Velocity" article
 * by Euclidean Space,
 * (https://www.euclideanspace.com/physics/kinematics/angularvelocity/)
